# OSSM ALT Edition

Alternative community version for the well known [OSSM](https://github.com/KinkyMakers/OSSM-hardware). Consider this experimental. 

<sub>**Notice**: This version was developed without any involvement of the original OSSM / Research and Desire members. However, none of this would have been possible without their prior work which is greatly appreciated. </sub>

## Key Changes:

- Complete redesign around a custom 28V 140Watt USB-C PCB
- Made for [OSSM Rust](https://github.com/orange-gem/ossm-rs)
- Works with MGN15H rails (The PCB / Motor mount is compatible with the standard OSSM mechanics)
- Supports 15MM belts
- Optimized for assembly in Europe (BOM with very common parts that can easily be sourced)
- Compatible with Pitclamp Mini, but a different version optimzed for this design is included. 
- Actual usable travel is rail length - 150mm
